What astronomy classes have you taken? I have taken Intro to Astronomy with Lab (AST 2002) and Asteroids, Comets, Meteorites (AST 4142)

Are you generally comfortable with calculus and physics? Yes, I took up to and including Calculus III and Physics II.

Have you ever programmed a computer? No

In what language(s)? N/A

Have you taken a programming class, and if so which? Yes, Intro to C++ and Modeling Methods which used MatLab.

Have you taken statistics or probability? Yes, Statistics for Engineers.

Will you be attending the DPS conference this year, or will you be away otherwise? No

Why are you taking this course? I am taking this as a technical elective for my degree in Mechanical Engineering and as a way to satisfy my Astronomy Minor.

Are there particular topics you hope to learn? My overall goal for this course is to become more comfortable with utilizing coding and programming for research purposes. Specific topics of interest include fitting theoretical models to observed measurements, presenting research, and spectroscopy.

If you have programmed outside of a course before, please briefly describe: N/A

If you have worked with scientific data before, briefly describe your experience: In addition to labwork through my courses, I am also an undergraduate researcher studying the effects of humidity on lunar highlands regolith simulant. This work primarily focuses on evaluating moisture content levels at numerous conditions and at various depths, data which can accumulate quickly if not kept organized. 

Please describe any projects in astronomy, including involvement in amateur groups, owning a telescope, research, etc.: I was part of my high school's Astronomy Club from 2015 to 2016, was the founder and president of my community college's Astronomical Society from 2016 to 2018; a member of the Central Florida Astronomical Society in 2020, am an amateur astrophotographer, and own my own telescope.

Explain how you will do the following steps:
- Make the folder hw0_<yourname>/.
	 In my ast4762 folder I have created four sub-folders: Handin, Homework, Lectures, and Literature based on the instructions given in homework_format_rules.pdf. I will double-click the Homework folder. From there, I am going to right-click > select "New" > select "Folder". The new folder will appear with the title "New Folder" highlighted in blue meaning the name cam be adjusted at this time. I will rename the folder "hw0_abigailglover" by typing it in and clicking the enter key. This step is now complete. 

- Copy your log file in your hw0_<yourname>/ folder.
	To copy my log file to hw0_abigailglover, I will go to its location in Desktop > right-click the file > select "Copy" > navigate to the ast4762 folder also located in Desktop > double-click the "Homework" folder to open > double-click the "hw0_abigailglover" folder to open > right-click > select "Paste". This step is now complete.
 
- Zip the hw0_<yourname>/ folder.
		In the Homework folder, I am going to right-click the folder "hw0_abigailglover" > click "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) Folder". This will generate a compressed folder with its title highlighted blue to be renamed. I will then update the name to "hw0_abigailglover". I will then copy this folder into the "Handin" folder as per the instructions listed in homework_format_rules.pdf. The folder is now compressed and this step is complete.

- Submit the zip file to Webcourses.
	Navigate to the appropriate assignment on Webcourses and start the assignment. Select the corresponding compressed (zipped) folder in the Handin folder under "ast4762" and upload. Submit the assignment. This step is now complete.
