# Define variables
R = 3  # Read noise in photoelectrons
N_star = 900  # Number of photoelectrons per second
t1 = 5  # Exposure time in seconds
S = 13  # Number of pixels
p = 1  # Number of pixels

# Number of exposures

# Calculate SNR for one exposure
SNR_one_exposure = (N_star * t1) / math.sqrt(N_star * t1 + S * p * t1 + p * R**2)

# Calculate total SNR for all exposures
SNR_total = math.sqrt(N_exposures1) * SNR_one_exposure

# Print the expression for the SNR
print('\nThe expression to find the SNR for the sum of all signals (with the same conditions) over multiple exposures is:')

print('SNR = sigma[ (N_star * t)/sqrt(N_star * t + S * p * t + p * R^2) ]')

# Question
print('\n\nWhat is the SNR if you take ten 5-second exposures?')

# Answer

# Update variables

# Question
print('\n\nHow about when taking just one 50-second integration?')

#Answer
print(f"The SNR for one 50-second exposure is: {SNR_total2 : .2f}")

# Question
print('\n\nWhich is better and why?')

# Answer
print('A single, longer exposure is better than multiple short exposures.')
print('This is because a longer exposure allows more time for light from\n\
faint, deep-sky objects to be gathered, typically resulting in clearer,\n\
more detailed images in darker areas than short exposures provide.')

# Question
print('\n\nWhat are some other practical considerations (pro or con) besides just the hypothetical SNR?')

# Answer for short exposures
print('Considerations for short exposures:')
print('- PRO: Taking multiple short exposures reduces the risk of losing the entire (or most of the) data set.')
print('- PRO: It is easier to gather calibration frames from short exposures')
print('- PRO: There is less risk of oversaturating the pixels with short exposures')
print('- CON: Greater demand for data management.')
print('- CON: May not be an effective use of telescope time')
print('- CON: There is more noise in the data')

# Answer for long exposures
print('\nConsiderations for long exposures:')
print('- PRO: Noise is minimized')
print('- PRO: Can be a more efficient use of telescope time')
print('- PRO: Better signal-to-noise ratio')
print('- PRO: Provides more information (more data) from darker objects')
print('- CON: May cause oversaturation in pixels depending on the observed object')
print('- CON: Increased risk of higher data loss if something is corrupt')
print('- CON: More difficulty in gathering calibration frames')

print('\nNote: There is no one answer for which exposure is better. Often, a combination\n\
of the two is used by professionals depending on their research needs.')

# Question
print('\n\nNote that the CCD Equation in Howell is for calculating one frameâ€™s SNR.')
print('How would you modify it for multiple exposures?')

# Answer
print('To account for more than one exposure with the same conditions, I multiplied the number\n\
of exposures by the SNR equation for a single frame to get the total SNR value.')

# Answer
print('\nFor these specific files, the objects did not provide the time\n\
of the observation, meaning that it may not have been recorded or\n\
was possibly corrupted. Typically, researchers would prefer both\n\
the date and time of observations to maximize the data. However,\n\
while time provides specific information about when an observation\n\
occurred within a specific day, the date offers a broader context\n\
and is relevant for various applications. So if having to choose\n\
between the two, it is more beneficial to print the date.')
