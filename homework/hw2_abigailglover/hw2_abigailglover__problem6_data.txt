Skyfield is a powerful and versatile open-source software 
designed for the precise calculation of celestial object 
positions, including stars, planets, and satellites, through 
advanced vector operations. It leverages Earth's orbital 
data to provide highly accurate results, typically aligning 
closely with the United States Naval Observatory's 
Astronomical Almanac with a precision of +/- 0.0005 
arcseconds. Skyfield seamlessly integrates with both Python 
2 and 3, and it relies on NumPy as its sole binary dependency,
making it accessible and user-friendly for astronomers and
researchers seeking reliable astronomical computations and data.


Astropy is a renowned open-source software package designed 
to cater to the needs of astronomers and astrophysicists. 
It provides a large set of tools, libraries, and functions. 
Astropy serves as a collaborative platform that aims to 
standardize and streamline data formats and conventions within 
the field, facilitating seamless interoperability between 
various other astronomical software packages. It has
widespread community support and the creators boast commitment
to continue to improve upon the tools available.
